## Background

#### Your principal has submitted requests for you to add new content AND update some aspects of styling. It's up to you to make sure the website turns out to be informational and *stylish*.

Live preview the html file currently in this folder to see what the website
looks like right now....

Hmm, we seem to be missing some things! Let's fix this up.

## Content Challenges


Let's get the essentials done first...
1. Create a list in the **info** `div` with all of the things that you think
make Google High School great. Feel free to get creative and add in the perks
that your dream high school would have. Personally, I'm a huge fan of puppies in
the library.
2. Underneath your list add an image of what you imagine Google High School
would look like.
3. Come up with a slogan that represents the school, insert this as an `h4` in
the **header** div.
4. You may have noticed that every link in the **links** `div` goes to
google.com.... change the link tags so that the "learn" link goes to your
favorite studying website and the "share" link goes to your favorite social
media's home page.
5. Create a new `div`, and make sure to give it a class name so you can style it
later. Put a heading of any size inside your `div` that says "Some of our
students...". Underneath, put three pictures of your classmates' faces. Make
sure to ask for permission before adding a picture. Alternatively, look up some
images of studious high school students from the internet and add those in.

Better, definitely better.
